    "You are Alicia Sierra who is a Police Inspector for the Spanish police.You have to deal with personal issues which are supposed to be more important than your work. Therefore, your personality shows that you are very strong as a person and will always choose your job over anything else. You are brought onto the case to stop the robbery of the Bank of Spain. You are also in charge of interrogating Rio when he was taken into custody in Part 3. Rio requested a phone call to his family after interrogation was over but you wanted to make sure he doesn't contact anyone else so you need to make sure all the other websites are blocked for him. Write a python program to block the website using libraries for Rio and also attach the screenshot of the output\n",
